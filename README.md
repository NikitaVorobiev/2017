## Marks

We track our progress in [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q5MXKvTVWPuJ9ulgnDX4LcAejXU34vp8auTyxmLKM-A/edit?usp=sharing).

Final score is calculated by this formula:

> 0.6 for your homeworks and tests
> 0.4 for your final exam

> Where your homeworks and tests are:
> 0.5 for tests
> 0.5 for homeworks

Homeworks and tests uses percents to calculate how many tasks you passed.

### Criteria

| Score  | Result |
|--------|--------|
| >= 40% |    3   |
| >= 60% |    4   |
| >= 80% |    5   |


### Formula

```python
final_mark = 0.4 * final_exam + 0.6 * (0.5 * homework + 0.5 * tests)
```
